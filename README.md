# [Graeco-Latin Square Poems](https://github.com/powderflask/gls-poetry)


A new poetic form based on a Graeco-Latin square, by Lisa Lajeunesse.
Because of their shape, Graeco-Latin square poems fall within a category known as pattern poetry.
Each ùëõ √ó ùëõ square produces 2 stanza(s) consisting of n lines of poetry, ordered by the Graeco-Latin square.

This form also lends itself to poetry puzzles -- logic puzzles, similar to Sudoku, that are based on combinatorial designs. 
The solved puzzle unscrambles the words of a poem.
